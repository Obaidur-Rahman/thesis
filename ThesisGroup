This paper presents an actual model of hybrid wind and solar strength technology.
The layout of this model especially set on highway divider ,in which the air force is produced by moving vehicles to produce electricity. Also, this model can be utilized to fulfill the power requirement for household application where the grid is not available.


This Block Diagram shows an overview of how it works to generate electricity.  PV system or solar power system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. The inverter changes direct current into alternating current. Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) controller used to charge the battery.
